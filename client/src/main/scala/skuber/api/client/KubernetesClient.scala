/**
  * @author David O'Riordan
  *
  * This trait defines the skuber Kubernetes client API
  * The client API supports making requests on Kubernetes resources that are represented using the Skuber case class based data model.
  * Generally most methods target a specific namespace that has been configured for the client, but some methods can target other namespaces -
  * the descriptions and signatures of those methods should make it clear in those cases,
  * Most of the methods are typed to either a specific object resource type O or list resource type L, and require one or more of the
  * following implicit parameters, which arenormally suppied when you make some standard imports as described in the programming guide:
  * - A ResourceDefinition that supplies skuber with key details needed to make the call on the applicable resource type. These are
  * defined on the companion object of the case class that implements the resource type so generally you do not have to explicitly
  * import them.
  * - A Play JSON Format instance that knows how to marshal/unmarshal values of the applicable resource type for sending to and receiving
  * from the API server. Many of these are imported from specific json objects (e.g. skuber.json.format), but some are defined on
  * the companion object of the applicable resource type.
  * - A LoggingContext which provides additional details in the skuber logs for each call - unless overridden this will be a
  * skuber.api.client.RequestLoggingContext instance, which just adds a unique request id to the request/response logs.
  *
  * See the Skuber programming guide and examples for more information on how to use the API.
